# e-commerce-back-end

## Introduction

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). 
This is was a challenge to build a command-line application to manage an employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
